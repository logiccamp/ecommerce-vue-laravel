							<h3>Shipping:&nbsp;</h3>



							<p>If Ustora(“we”) has your product(s) in stock, we will email you a shipping notice confirming that the items have shipped and are en-route to you or, in the case of delivered orders, a special delivery notice confirming the scheduled delivery date; that shipping notice or special delivery notice, as applicable, is our acceptance of your order. In-stock orders (excluding scheduled delivery items) normally ship within 2 business days of placing your order. Out-of-stock orders will ship once the item is back in stock. How soon you receive the product(s) depends on the shipping method you have chosen.</p>



							<h3>Pre-orders</h3>



							<p>Release dates for products can sometimes change without notice or liability. If you’ve pre-ordered a product, we’ll ship it as soon as possible after its final release date, which may be different from the initial date advertised.</p>

							<p>To the extent permitted by law, we reserve the right at any time to reject, correct, cancel or terminate any order for any reason whatsoever. If the price of any product you order was incorrectly displayed on our Web Site, we will provide you with an opportunity to place an order at the correct price.</p>



							<p>Advertisements on our Web Site are invitations to you to make offers to purchase products and services on the Web Site and are not offers to sell.

That shipping notice email or special delivery notice email constitutes our acceptance of your order and forms a legally binding contract with Ustora Store Ltd.</p>

If you wish to cancel an order, you may request a cancellation by logging into your account and cancelling your order or by calling (607) 205-8269. However, we may not receive and process your cancellation request before we accept your order, in which case your cancellation request may not be effective. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with a product you have purchased, you may return it according to our Returns and Exchanges policy.</p>



							<p>Entire Agreement<br>The above Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede any and all preceding and contemporaneous agreements between you and Ustora.
