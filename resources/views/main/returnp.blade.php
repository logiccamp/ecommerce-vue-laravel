							<p>If you would like to make a return, take a look at our policies below. We want to make sure you’re completely happy with your purchase. If there’s anything we can do to improve your experience, please contact us at hello@ustora.com.</p>



							<h3>Return Policy</h3>



							<p>We’ll accept return requests for items that are unopened, unused, with the original tags still intact. The product(s) must be in their original packaging, if applicable, in the same condition it was received.</p>



							<p>We do not accept returns for perishable items, intimate items, gift cards, downloadable products, and beauty items.</p>



							<p>If you wish to return your item, we must receive your request within 14 days of the date you received your item.</p>



							<h3>Refunds</h3>



							<p>Once we receive your returned item, our team will review your request and inspect the item. We will send you an email to confirm that we’ve received your item and are processing your request. We’ll follow up with another email once the request has been processed to let you know if your return was approved.</p>



							<p>If approved, the money will be refunded to your original method of payment within two weeks. All payment companies are different in the amount of time it takes to confirm a payment, so it will likely take a minimum of a few days for the refund to show up in your bank statement.</p>



							<h3>Exchanges</h3>



							<p>In the unlikely event that you receive a damaged or defective item, we’re happy to exchange the item for a new one. Please email <a href="mailto:hello@ustora.com">hello@ustora.com</a> within 30 days of receiving your product to begin the process.</p>



							<h3>Return Shipping</h3>



							<p>After you’ve submitted a return request to <a href="mailto:hello@ustora.com">hello@ustora.com</a> , we will send you a PDF of a return shipping label. Please print it out and affix to your package.</p>



							<p>You are responsible for paying for the return shipping costs. We will deduct the cost of return shipping from your refund.</p>



							<h3>Final Sale Items</h3>



							<p>If the item is marked “final sale”, it does not qualify for a return and cannot be refunded.</p>



							<h3>Insurance</h3>



							<p>If you’re shipping an item over $75, consider purchasing shipping insurance to ensure it arrives. We can’t guarantee that we’ll receive your item.</p>
